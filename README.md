# Forensics-File-Extractor
This is a nifty tool I created that automates the go/jump bag scenario in Forensics. This tool can be deployed on a USB persistence version of kali.
```
How To Run:

-Create a USB with kali installed on it.

-Login as root

-Create a folder in /root/.config called autostart and place the .desktop file in that.

-Place the folder with code on the Desktop.
```
# Packages used:
